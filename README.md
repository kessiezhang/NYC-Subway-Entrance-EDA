# NYC-Subway-Entrance-EDA

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY- a fictitious organization) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As they are new and inclusive organization, they try to do double duty with the gala both to fill their event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.

### *Project Goal:*
The goal of this project is to maximize the numbers of signitures obtained at subway station entrances/exits via street marketing teams, focusing on those individuals who are interested to attend the gala and contribute to WTWYâ€™s cause.
To do so, we will look at MTA subway data as well as NYC Census data to determine, not just the busiest stations, but the stations with the most value-added individuals considering our prompt above. In addition, we plan to look at technology companies in the areas near stations to determine best allotment of street marketing team placement.
